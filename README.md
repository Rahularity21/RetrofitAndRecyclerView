# RetrofitAndRecyclerView
This is a simple app which gets the top rated movies list from http://api.themoviedb.org/3/ 
The api sends a JSON format of the top rated movies which we get from this query http://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/top_rated?api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
The information is received by retrofit and by using RecyclerView Adapter, all the info is shown on the screen
Basically it is a working example of both RecyclerView and Retrofit together.
